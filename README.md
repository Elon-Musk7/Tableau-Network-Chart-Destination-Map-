# Tableau-Network-Chart-Destination-Map

In this workshop we will be using this small mock dataset for logistics to create a network (destination) map. 

There are two datasets uploaded here, the raw one is the original data, and the modified one is what is needed to create the map. The modification could be done beforehand or in Tableau.

The final visualization looks like:
